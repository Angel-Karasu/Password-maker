# Password Maker

This is a simple password maker project that creates an unique password for every website. If a site is hacked, your other passwords can't be found, but with its secret key-based generation, you'll easily find your own passwords, even without a password manager.

## How to use

To use this password maker, simply go on the [password maker website](https://angel-karasu.github.io/PasswordMaker/) and complete the fields. You must enter at least one secret key but it's recommended to use several secret keys. See the `password.js` file if you want to understand how the password maker works.
